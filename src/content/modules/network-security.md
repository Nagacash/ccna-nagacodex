# Network Security Module

This module covers essential network security concepts and practices that are crucial for the CCNA certification. You'll learn how to implement security measures to protect network infrastructure and data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement access control lists (ACLs) to filter network traffic
- Configure port security on switches to prevent unauthorized access
- Understand and implement device hardening techniques
- Configure basic firewall functionality
- Identify common security threats and mitigation strategies

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Configuring Standard and Extended ACLs
Implement ACLs to control traffic flow between networks based on source/destination addresses and protocols.

### Lab 2: Implementing Port Security
Configure port security on switches to limit the number of MAC addresses per port and prevent MAC address spoofing.

### Lab 3: Device Hardening
Apply best practices for securing Cisco devices, including password policies, SSH configuration, and disabling unused services.

### Lab 4: Configuring Zone-Based Firewall
Implement basic firewall functionality to protect internal networks from external threats.

### Lab 5: Security Monitoring and Logging
Configure logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
