# IP Services Module

This module covers essential IP services that are critical for network operations and part of the CCNA certification. You'll learn how to configure and troubleshoot various network services that enhance connectivity and management.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Configure and verify DHCP on Cisco routers
- Implement Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT)
- Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) for time synchronization
- Understand and implement quality of service (QoS) mechanisms
- Configure and troubleshoot SNMP and Syslog for network monitoring

## Topics Covered

### 1. DHCP Configuration
- DHCP operation and message types
- Configuring DHCP server on Cisco routers
- DHCP relay agent configuration
- DHCP troubleshooting
- DHCPv6 basics

### 2. Network Address Translation (NAT)
- NAT concepts and terminology

- Dynamic NAT configuration
- Port Address Translation (PAT)
- NAT troubleshooting

### 3. Network Time Protocol (NTP)
- NTP architecture and operation
- Configuring NTP server and client
- NTP authentication
- NTP troubleshooting
- Time zones and daylight saving time

### 4. Quality of Service (QoS)
- QoS concepts and models
- Classification and marking
- Congestion management
- Congestion avoidance
- Traffic policing and shaping

### 5. Network Monitoring
- SNMP configuration
- Syslog implementation
- NetFlow basics
- IP SLA overview
- Network monitoring best practices

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: DHCP Configuration
Configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server and implement DHCP relay for remote networks.

### Lab 2: NAT and PAT Implementation
Configure static NAT, dynamic NAT, and PAT to enable internal hosts to access the internet.

### Lab 3: NTP Configuration
Set up NTP server and client relationships to ensure time synchronization across the network.

### Lab 4: QoS Implementation
Configure basic QoS mechanisms to prioritize voice and video traffic over data traffic.

### Lab 5: Network Monitoring Setup
Implement SNMP and Syslog for centralized network monitoring and troubleshooting.
