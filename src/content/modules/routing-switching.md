# Routing & Switching Module

This module covers the essential concepts of routing and switching that are core to the CCNA certification. You'll learn how to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches in a network environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Configure basic settings on Cisco routers and switches
- Understand and implement VLANs and trunking
- Configure and verify inter-VLAN routing
- Implement static and dynamic routing protocols
- Troubleshoot common routing and switching issues

## Topics Covered

### 1. Router and Switch Basics
- Router components and functions
- Switch components and functions
- Basic device configuration
- IOS command structure
- Device management and security

### 2. VLANs and Trunking
- VLAN concepts and benefits
- Creating and assigning VLANs
- VLAN trunking protocol (VTP)
- Trunk configuration
- Native VLANs and voice VLANs

### 3. Inter-VLAN Routing
- Router-on-a-stick configuration
- Layer 3 switching
- SVI (Switched Virtual Interface)
- Troubleshooting inter-VLAN routing

### 4. Routing Fundamentals
- Static routing
- Default routing
- Administrative distance
- Routing tables
- Path selection

### 5. Dynamic Routing Protocols
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- Route redistribution basics

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Basic Router and Switch Configuration
Configure hostnames, passwords, banners, and management interfaces on Cisco devices.

### Lab 2: VLAN Configuration
Create VLANs, assign ports to VLANs, and configure trunking between switches.

### Lab 3: Inter-VLAN Routing
Configure router-on-a-stick to enable communication between different VLANs.

### Lab 4: Static Routing
Configure static routes to enable communication between different networks.

### Lab 5: OSPF Configuration
Implement OSPF routing protocol in a multi-router environment.

### Lab 6: Routing Protocol Troubleshooting
Identify and resolve common routing protocol issues.
